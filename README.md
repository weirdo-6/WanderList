### 👋 Challenges
In this development, my main challenge was to understand and apply the MaterializeCSS, as by that time, I had only experience with the Bootstrap framework.

***

### 🌟 Key learnings & wins
In this project I worked independently and I had the opportunity to gain more fluency in Python, Django, Mongoose. I enjoyed building this full stack app while applying styling by using MaterializeCSS.

Although this was a class deliverable, It was a win to develop and apply all functions we were currently learning in class.
